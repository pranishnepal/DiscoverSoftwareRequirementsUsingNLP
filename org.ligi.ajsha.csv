The only limitation I have found is in trying to set up a project (to work with inheritance, et.al).

ru.iiec.jvdroid,Kashish,Best educational app. Thanks for this app.,5
ru.iiec.jvdroid,Rishabh kumar,"Its is best java compiler on mobile. Love the efforts of the developers to bring compilation right in our pocket devices. On the other hand.. Java is a language,that give me kindaa proffestional vibes,but the Ui/Ux of the app is kept similar to the other IIEC compilers like CxxDroid and Pydroid . I just expected a different look than the other compilers. However i still appreciate your work.. keep it up . And thanks",4

ru.iiec.jvdroid,Daniel Glaser,"Would be five stars but... I was working on a project, test ran it, and had to sit through a five second forced commercial for a mobile game. It disrupted my work, and broke my chain of thought. The twist? This is the fully paid version. Please remove the ads in the PAID edition, and I will give you the five stars you deserve.",3

ru.iiec.jvdroid,Raj Kumar Srivastava,best among all other decoding apps .Its just fabulous,5
ru.iiec.jvdroid,blueslimee,Perfect! Would be even better if you add full Kotlin support (code analysis and prediction). (Edit: That would be awesome!),5
ru.iiec.jvdroid,Dominic Tjiptono,This app is just fine except that the app closes itself when I try to delete the text I highlighted. I find the app not very good for creating complex Java applications. The app prevents me from creating complex Java applications since I had to press backspace for so long to remove a lot of text to make many changes and also need to type the same tedious lines of code without copy pasting just to repeat some lines of codes used in multiple places.,3
ru.iiec.jvdroid,Nagaraj P,"This app eats RAM, compiling time is also more... But compiles well. We have to climb this one since no better offline compiler than this in Google play... Try to improve ads are too much annoying....",2
ru.iiec.jvdroid,MonAaraj,"Amazing!! Though, Im a little bit biased... I subscribed to premium right after opening it, It's perfect.",5
ru.iiec.jvdroid,Michael Townley,"Great app, but the let-down is the run time. When I run my code, Loading Maven comes up and downloads random stuff. I have made 3 codes and each took forever to run. It is even worse with Kotlin. Other than that, it is great to see a free version of Jvdroid because Google Play is lacking of good Java IDEs",3

com.paprbit.dcoder,Ardelean vlad george,"Good app. Works ok with Haskell. Auto-closing parentheses are annoying because when you're typing "")"", the IDE forgets it already added a "")"", so adds another one. Auto-closing can be turned off, so not a big issue. It needs an interner connection in order to work. I think that's because it stores your source files on the server AND ALSO the execution happens on the server. It's fine if you don't care, but FYI, you won't be able to code if you go to the North Pole :p Decent app!",4

com.paprbit.dcoder,Sanmitra Goswami,I would really love giving it five stars. It is probably the best Compiler and IDE for programming. Supports a lot of languages. The compiler is fast and very good. You have challanges to test your skills. Also highlights the code professionally. brackets and inverted commas start and end at once. If the select one bracket the other one Instantly gets selected.however there is one problem for which I did not rate five stars. I cannot import or export the projects as separate file.,4

com.aide.ui,Nathan Thompson,This was a great app... until I discovered that they charge full price for a new license when they add features. I own the premium key which cost $15. If I want the debugger and UI tools I have to pay full price for another license. At this rate it will be cheaper to buy an x86 laptop and download Android studio than to continue investing in this app. @appfour My premium license is on my G Suite account which can't leave reviews because Google won't allow it.,1

Your IDE doesn't support the latest Android Studio features like AndroidX which is really a shame because AppCompat libraries are broken now for which reason I don't know whether it's your fault or they stopped releasing Support Libs anymore. What I mean is that I tried to manually install AndroidX through looking up their gradle repos. I got errors saying that this xml tag is not found in namespace android. Which means your IDE is old. OLD: Bought it and I'm glad I did,3

The version 2.2.6 I used before did not have these bugs, but sadly it does not work on new Android (due to ""non-PIE executable"" error). The bugs are: - Almost always when scrolling a source file it suddenly jumps to the beginning of it, and you have to scroll down again, and then, while you scroll, it may repeat jumps again and again, so it is really hard to scroll to the place you need. - Often when building the project it does not catch the changes from source files and the old APK is built and installed. To overcome it I have to change something in the source file, rebuild, change the file back and rebuild again. - It does not regard the lock of screen orientation and always rotates the screen even if I do not want it to.  There are also other issues: - Git discard cannot discard the ""deleted file"" change, so to restore the file I have to use some external Git tool. - AIDE crashes quite often (especially after going back to edit mode after textual search). - Git diff shows fake line numbers instead of real line numbers from source files, so it is hard to find the change in a large file.",2

com.aide.ui,David Augustat,"Was once a great app - isn't anymore. This was a very good app a few years ago, but it got so much worse that you can barely use it without buying the premium version (15‚Ç¨). Now you can't even save a file without having to pay. And the popup saying that you should buy the premium version comes up every few seconds. Also the support for this app got much worse over time. In 2014 there were updates nearly every week. Now this app only receives an update every few months. Please stop squeezing this app for money!",1

Take the Cordova integration, which is a non-starter since it's using an old, insecure version. Developers have been totally nonresponsive to reviews and emails asking about this.

But you don't know how much it will cost you totally - at the end.  Such app should be forbidden unless its description specifies cost at each stage and full cost of whole course.  Edit: there's a product called AIDE Premium Key, which is priced about $20, unblocking paid sections in AIDE, but no longer valid - for new downloads only in-app payments work. One can assume the new business model gives them better income - otherwise there would be no need to withdraw single payment variant. So expect the total cost substantially higher than $20...",1

It will do this over and over again til it downloads and doesn't delete the failed package so you have a 200mb download that failed and won't delete.

This is ignoring that the app will charge you money to save your source code. I used to use this app, but now I regret every good word I spoke of this.

Secondary launch was disabled and this app needs to invoke Google play store to verify the status of key. [I have to open Google play store first otherwise this app will spam ads even if i have bought dev key. Can you fix this problem? Other apps I bought on Google play could work normally without Google play store being opened. The functionality is sufficient for app development on mobile.],5

com.aide.ui,Lew Perren,"I have been using AIDE for six months and have used it to develop three apps. I have experience of using Eclipse, so Android Studio was an obvious choice. However, it ran slow on my old steam driven laptop and there is something cool about developing directly on an Android device. I have not been disappointed, AIDE is a great IDE. As a previous Java programmer, most of my knowledge transfered well, but the AIDE interface and infrastructure helps with some of the Android specific aspects that I did not know. It is little things like the autogeneration on the subdirectory stuctures, the way it imports resources, the faultless intellisense (sorry to use a Microsoft VS term), and continuous update with changes in Android that make this a pleasure to use and really optimize developer time. The only feature I haven't been able to find, or may be does not exist is code fold. I find this helpful to overview the structure of classes. I can't comment too much on the tutorial system as I have mostly used it as an IDE, but if you want a professional Android based IDE then you really should get AIDE. Thanks for the development and keep up the good work.",5
