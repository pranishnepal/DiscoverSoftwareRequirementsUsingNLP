com.eventbrite.attendee,Shir Carson,"Amazing App User-friendly, easily maneuvering around. I like that the AI connects you to options that you may like or throw something at you that you never thought of. I like that someone else may not.

Then when I look at an event and come back out takes me to the top of the list and I have to scroll through them all again!

com.eventbrite.attendee,Alan Aperlo,Great job.,5
com.eventbrite.attendee,Melissa Killion,I loved this app until they removed the map function.

com.eventbrite.attendee,Cait K,"Has the events I want to sign up to. Not much point to having the app over the website. It's really too bad that when signing up for tickets the info doesn't autoload. Akai can't bulk purchase events and when signing up to online events and it makes a calendar event, it does not give you a link to the call platform event. Instead you have to go to the email where the ticket is to find the link. Such a hassle!!",2

com.eventbrite.attendee,Lucy and Paul Irven,"You should distinguish your retail app from your merchant app more clearly. Buying a couple of tickets: the layout was unclear, and it wasn't obvious that I should scroll down after entering my name (though that was supplied from my account profile); I only succeeded in the purchase on the third attempt.

com.eventbrite.attendee,Scott Bown,"Not the best checkout experience, got bounced around the app and the site when I selected I'd rather pay with my Credit Card over PayPal (I don't know what you have against that). Waited while the app ""processed my payment"" but no progress was made. When I backed out of that it told me I actually did purchase tickets, I guess. App appears to be buggy in this regard.

When filling out registration forms, if it doesn't like the info you've entered, it just says to fill out the highlighted sections but doesn't actually highlight anything, so you have to guess what it wants you to do. The timer for completing your ticket purchase resets if you open anything else on your phone or if your phone goes to a screensaver, which means you'll have to re-enter all your info when you leave for a minute to find your credit card.

My complaint is when I have to look something up...the app won't always recognize what event you're referring to even when inputting verbatim the exact title. I find that to be odd but it happens quite frequently. I feel as though once you have the direct link, you're fine as it pulls you straight to what you click on but tat isn't always the case when looking for events that you know are offered thru here.",4

com.eventbrite.attendee,Russell Hyder,May change this rating later. Pretty poor experience using Eventbrite unfortunately. I purchased tickets to Youmacon 2020 but we all know how events went in 2020. Nice thing is that we were told that our tickets would be rolled over to the next year. One month till event and so far only information we have it that Eventbrite had an error and tickets would roll over when it's fixed. I can't guarantee that it will happen and was forced to buy the pass again. Will change if rollover happens.,2

Worse, it's impossible to purchase tickets with anything other than a credit card (e.g. PayPal, which is often the only option) due to a server error message that obscures the PayPal login dialog and cannot be dismissed. Add that to 2000s-era pop-up payment windows on the website and it's like they don't actually want you to be able to pay for tickets.",1

I get it - you're at the meetup location, you can share it yay! Youre at home and you share your location without being able to delete it and this app enables all sorts of nasty possibilities.",1

Same when you upload the picture for the event which comes at the end. So I had to re-enter 3 times these fields, otherwise my event would have been created at the wrong date and time!

My new group did not go through a validation stating that I did not cover 4 questions in the description (which I believe I covered) and they will review it again in 3 days... if they want some questions to be answered why they don't have mandatory fields or at least set expectations right in the beginning rather than pushing you back and forth. 2. It's very buggy. My group got created as a duplicate and then would not allow any updates. Who is paying me for doing their UAT?,1

com.meetup,Sash Rob,"A meetap organisers can delete comments and that it is in my opinion censorship if an organiser can delete all critical input. However it is a basic human right to be able to voice ones opinion. Uncensored comments are very important for new/interested visitors. That way they get a feeling for the group and can decide if it is fine with them. As a company meetup enables censorship by giving the deletion right to the organiser. That is highly critical. I prefer the google strategy because 99% of the comments, positive and negative, are published and only violations to the policy, will be rejected. Rightly so. With that google allows that the ""whole truth"" of the group/app/whatever is known. Enabling each and everyone to decide if they can live with that or not. Giving the organizer the right to decide what is published allows them to ""paint their picture of the group"" which will probably not reflect the ""truth"" of the group. Worldwide maybe thousands of people will therefore have negative experiences. And the vulnerable amongst us maybe even find themselves in a critical/dangerous set up. What it really does is to give room to intolerance, whitewashing and a lack of personal development as a group. @Developer Response MeetUp: The above description should suffice for you to see the necessity to disable the deletion right for the organiser.",1

If you sort by date & time, if the list is too, then by around 4 or 5pm, suddenly the filtered list only shows 2 more events happening in the day. In Los Angeles, that is never, ever the case.

com.meetup,Annie Trouble,"The idea is good but the notifications drive me nuts and there aren't many options to calm them down. You can't decline a meetup. They will notify you about the event.

It seems the groups have forgotten what it's like to be new. I was not greeted, people moved tables to stay in their clicks, yelled at by another leader and made to feel isolated.

Also, I could never change my going or not going selection. The app isn't terrible but sometimes it's best to leave well enough alone. Updating: I agree with a lot of the other replies I'm reading. Also, this is messy to navigate. There are so many dates and events, no calendar, so missing out on events is easy. Should delete old dates, that's not being done.",2

com.meetup,Barbara Prange,I have always loved this app until I tried installing on a new device. There's no way to sign in if you are an existing member. The only way that I can see what's happening in MY particular group is by going through the website. I have often wondered why the older members of our group have said to avoid the app...it doesn't work....when my version worked fine. Now I get it. Please make the app usable for everyone.,1

com.meetup,Shaun S,"Very Expensive, poor customer service, poor app features. Used to love the app before meetup was bought out. Now it sucks. I'm a bit disappointed with their marketing gimmick. Advertised cost to start a meetup is $120 a year but this tiered service is essentially broken since many people will simply sign up to a group to be part of the mailing list. Next tier is $180 a year and is what they push you towards once you've created your group.",1

com.meetup,Amy Lee Rue,"Not impressed. I cannot change my alert notification on my phone nor on my table. When I attempt to add it to my laptop, where I can supposedly make the changes to my alerts, I cannot because it is already on my phone and my laptop and it does not allow me to download it unto the laptop as well....

com.meetup,Andre Cofer,meetup help me meet people around the world that take the same interest in life...but also in the same area where im at.,5
com.meetup,Raphael Iyageh,"I absolutely hate the new feature that asks you to confirm that you are attending after you've hit the attend button. Developers should change this back to how it was. For the use case of adding guests, let that be dealt with after submission. A sort of edit/modify feature to add guests. This new feature, as is, is detrimental to users who sign up for events that fill up fast, and are time sensitive.",2
com.meetup,Steve Broe,I did contact meet up they can't figure out why my picture on app in corner is sideways,1

com.meetup,Laraine Leon,"Love Meetup!! I've been using the app for about a decade and I love being able to connect with local groups and get it to have some fun! I do feel the app/site needs an overhaul. Connecting directly with group members feels impossible! When will we see meetup chat? If I'm trying to give updates regarding an event, or get specific feedback, I need people updated ASAP, not whenever they check their email. It's not entirely user-friendly and the app is missing many features. Update please!!!",5

Currently you click on the comment notification and it brings up the event front page.

com.meetup,DutchRonin,"Platform as a whole, website and app, are getting worse and worse for organizers. Features are removed without notification. Event information is wrong or not updated. Getting slower overall. After 15 years we're considering moving to another site to organize events. No longer recommended.",2
com.meetup,Bruce Wayne,"Although the concept is good, the fact that you cannot create even a single group for free is disappointing, in my opinion. Every person should be able to create at least one group for free. There are better apps out there, that do allow members to create plans/invites/events etc, for free.",2
com.meetup,Margie Null,"The meetup groups are fantastic. as a widower of 3 years, this has been a fun, safe and interesting way of getting out, doing something fun and totally different with great groups of people. there is literally something for everyone, so many activities, interests and venues.

com.meetup,ady chong,"Super boring App , really dont understand , join a group with no discussion only want to MeetUp , can't send photo and not allow to freely express yourself , is ONE of the useless app in this century , cannot text nessage to each other to filter the other side , is not a safe app to be use .",1
com.meetup,Alexander Rivera,it's a great app and getting better every day. I just don't like the logo for the app itself. The logo just does not stand out as much but that's only a superficial knit pick.,5

com.meetup,Raygen Saunders-Johnson,Great app for making friends,5
com.meetup,K V,"No response through Messenger, sending template responses & not actually fixing up faults that has been happening since 2020 is not helping? 1) Meetup claiming events are free when they are not free. 2) Turned off notifications but I still get notifications of new events. 3) I am not a member of a Gold Coast art group but I still get notifications. 4) Why are interests added to my Meetup account when I am not interested in these. 5) To report issues takes you to their website not on the app etc",1
com.meetup,Jeril Peter,This is Awesome,5
com.meetup,Alan Stein,"Meetup brings together some of the the best aspects of both the virtual culture and the culture of person to person, real-life connections. The virtual part allows folks to easily find groups that are customized to be in sync with your interests, passions, and personality. Furthermore, it allows members to express interest in becoming a member. And, assuming that there are no snags in the process, allows members to confirm their participation in either a real-life OR a virtual event. BRAVO!!",5

com.meetup,Mr Foutch,"I haven't tried the app yet. Thanks everyone who has gone before me for the reviews. I'll just continue with the website. At least I already have some idea how it works.

com.meetup,Quana Charlton,just a great way to connect with people.,4
com.meetup,George Alexander Thorlton,"Editing this review after using the app for a few minutes, as opposed to the website. The app is effectively useless for me. The search function makes me choose a city and group category, which is far too fine-grained for rural areas. I went through each group category for my city and there were maybe 10 groups total, most of them in one of two categories. This isn't too surprising, but there's no way for me to expand my search aside from picking a random city in a different county/region.",1

com.meetup,Anastasia Pluish,"I use app as supplement to website. The main issue is not being able to ""contact attendees"" all together as an organizer and fake locations when searching for new groups - I'll select Philly as my location, the results will always list Philly under each group, but when I click on a group it's in San Francisco or whatnot. I've heard of these issues from many people. I don't feel like contacting anyone separately, you're informed here through reviews, ""message us here"" is fake caring copout.",3
com.meetup,Yvonne Turner,"I love the concept but the app is terrible. It always stalls, has error messages saying something is wrong and is just slow and cumbersome. I would recommend the developers try using it first hand to see all the problems.",2

com.meetup,Penny Mccollum,very fun group with all levels of ability,5
com.meetup,Joe Houghton,"Update: Still impossible to search events. No time of day filter. The event list is restricted so it doesn't show all of them. So if I'm looking for events on a Saturday evening it doesn't show all of them because I can't filter out events in the morning, and the list is restricted. Sorting by date means it shows only morning events and sorting by relevance shows irrelevant events (showing me 50+ age events when I'm in my 20s). The most basic stuff is still unusable after years.",1

After that, they removed me as organizer of the group that I created and offered this position to other people without my permission.

com.meetup,Monty Mukerji,I no longer receive emails when a new event is scheduled. The worst part is that I cannot contact a real person for tech support. It's canned responses from a bot. It kinda defeats the purpose of Meetup if I'm never notified of events.,1

com.meetup,Debora Flachsmann,"A good App to get into a new place/ country or society. Helpful to get into a community and shares plenty of ideas, how we can live our lifes more with fun and action. However that app is limited in their offerings. It doesnt gives me that much on offerings if its about a specific way of music or finding matching live music around the place where I live. In all of that I appreciate the App!",4
com.meetup,RandomZ5 Sharay,"Uninteresting Events. The idea is really nice but the events aren't the fun, clubby party type. It might be for an older demographic that keeps popping up for me.

com.meetup,Emre Yavuz,You have to click on notifications one by one to mark them as read. It's so annoying to do that. These types of things are old school tactics to make people read unnecessary things. Be modern meetup! Leave these old school tactics and invest to user experience,1

com.meetup,Theo Darling,"The app seems bad, and the website is also bad. The concept is good! But the process of selecting interests to filter results by could not be stupider, the profile settings could not be less accessible on the app version, and the results themselves are showing me groups from multiple states away. I'm especially annoyed about the interests part though because they're somehow both too limited AND labyrinthine. If you won't let us add our own interests, at least let us browse a complete list?!",2

com.meetup,Jennymk01,"Not the fault of the appmakers, but... It's 50% people who are trying to start cults, ""witchcraft,"" and weird spiritual stuff. (I didn't select religion lol) and the other 50% is too specific. It's wonderful there is a LGBT soccer leagues and skate nights, it's amazing to have fat positive lunches, and wonderful to have Christian hiking trips... But no one is just going hiking, or out to lunch, or anything... There is really nothing for someone under 21 that doesn't have any special traits. üòû",5

com.meetup,Shashikanth Manjunatha,nice,5
com.meetup,Josh,"The comment system drastically needs an overhaul in general, but especially so in the app. For one, push notifications don't say what was said (which would alleviate the following), but whenever you want to see what was said, you have to tap the notification, tap it again in your feed, scroll down to the comment section, and then DEDUCE what is new based on how recently a comment is made.

com.meetup,Nicole Stenerson,"Time zones are messed up, 2 meetings in a row now. Since these are support groups, it's incredibly frustrating when you structure your schedule around a meeting, only to login and WAIT FOR AN HR. I've had it. My anxiety is through the roof as it is, now I can't even be sure what time a meeting is supposed to start. And good luck getting ahold of customer support. There basically is none.

com.meetup,Tobias R,"Great social network which has given me lots of opportunities and development in life in the passed decade. However technically both the website and the apps are inferior with tons of glitches. At the amounts they charge for running groups one would expect better. As an icing on the cake,there is now almost daily notification spam about generic stuff from Meetup HQ too. The state of the site and app now reminds me of the former web portals of the 90s which slowly degenerated and became defunct.",2

com.meetup,Danila Popov,"Three stars lost for horrible ui. For every group you join there's 20+ options for different notifications and emails you'll get, which you'll have to opt out one at a time. Super annoying. And every once in a while the app forgets your notification/email options and starts spamming your phone and email",2
com.meetup,Brandon Allard,"I find it amazing that people who may find it difficult to find organizations or groups of people who share the same views, philosophy, social ideologies etc. can easily find that on Meetup; without the need of negative comments from others who may disagree with people simply doing what they enjoy to do.

com.meetup,Emily,"Event hosts use the free tag but then demand money in the description, almost all ""free"" events in my area demand money. It ruins the app. When you search for free events only, all that shows up are sneaky ones demanding cash in the description.

com.meetup,sunny sunny,"Part 2 of review: 2. Inspite of feedback on dead groups exisiting in app, no action taken to dissolve them. I assume meetup team just want to show some numbers to people to lure them to install the app. Otherwise, any serious professional team doesn't want to keep any such dummy groups. 3. Users can still use the app and join the groups. If you are happy seeing the counts of groups irrespective of the group's are active or dead, go on. Feedback continued in next review due to limitation",1

I've submitted a few for co-opting a group for unrelated (& controversial) topics which went ignored.

com.meetup,Christi Leeson,Great way to create community that actually meets in person. A great improvement would be helping community members be more aware of the message boards or another way to keep conversation going outside of the in-person meetings.,4
com.meetup,Valerie Livingstone,Please don't continue sitting by whilst the quality of the site deteriorates. The site should get better than when I joined all those years ago.

Ah figured it out by touching a photo. Not easy to use. Although I have push notifications turned on I am getting none. Not sure what the use of this would be if I can't get notices from my groups!,1
com.meetup,Amber Serrano,"I love how there's many groups and activities, even though where I live doesn't have that much. It's great to see so many options",5
com.meetup,US OFFICER,"This app is very good, but my problem is that When ever I send message to any group member, they will write up that my message is flag and not sent... Why?",3

com.meetup,Ann M.,"I'm not sure how the interface to the app can get worse. But now you no longer can tell what city an event is taking place. When you first click on the event all you see is the name of the location. Then when you scroll down the only other additional information you get is the street address but no city. üëéüëé Edit: Another issue I have with the interface, when clicking to add the event to your calendar instead of putting the event location into the location on the calendar it's putting in the meetup event url. That doesn't help me at all when trying to travel to the location based on what was auto entered into my calendar. Changing from 2 stars to 1 star.",1
com.meetup,Neal Raye,"this is a fascinating app! I've been posting events happening in the community so that families, seniors, and single people over the age of 21 can go out into the South Orange county and have fun on the cheap! in the first week we already have over 300 members. I've also met several of them already! I'm having a blast setting this up!",4

com.meetup,jimmyluu22 - GMAIL ACCOUNT,The app has gotten worse. In regards to the website and mobile app now you can't see events in the evening even if you click on the button to show more events. The event time cut off is set to 11am so I am only seeing events til then. How am I supposed to organize my week if I can't see meetups in the afternoon or evening? Also the UX is not better it looks worse and now takes more interactions to do what previously only took one button click,1

com.meetup,Shane,"The app accomplishes it's goalüëç Complaints: - many apparently dead groups that haven't had events for months, but have hundreds of members. Not sure why. Maybe they just use whatsapp. Blame Pandemic/poor group admin. - some groups seem to just be fronts for shilling regular weekly events that cost money (like $10 X dance practice Tuesday). - can't figure out how to change my interests on my profile. - the ""not going"" option for events is not in an intuitive location. Have to press ""attend"" 1st",4
com.meetup,Odunayo Ogunsanwo,great app,5
com.meetup,Marcus Suitor,It used to be much better before social media expanded on so many other free platforms but it's still a great tool to use in connecting with other likeminded people.

Meetup decided to change it to where if someone was 1 day past due, application removed them from being a member. That lost us tons of active members!

No ability to create or give members ""ranks"" which would help drastically in organizing events. The Mobile version doesnt have near the options that the web version has. I'm just seriously unimpressed. As soon as something else comes along I will change.",2
com.meetup,M Santangelo,"I can't really review an app i can't access. I cannot login. I'm online looking at my account but the app is giving me crazy errors like i tried to hack a bank, and the forget password request does the same thing. Lame.",1
com.meetup,James Daniels,Great app/concept. I feel like it could be easier to search and filter events by time/location,4

Please work on some more features- Editable messages, Timely notifications of relevant events, Reduce the premium to encourage more members and organizers.",3
com.meetup,Jeremy Fredde,"The app feels a little cluttered. Other than that, I really like it, especially compared to similar apps on the store. I wish there were more apps like meetup that were as user friendly and showed events or hosted events. Good job.",4

Location filters get ignored by search (set to London UK and I get stuff from Wellington NZ because I happen to be in a WLG-based group), app only loads 10-20 events max, can't change personal pics difficult to find events in general, poor event recommendations, no interest-blacklist etc etc. You suck nowadays.",1
com.meetup,Adam Wenham,great app,5
com.meetup,Miss Lindgren,"Love the calendar hold, attendance list, and ways to contact the group without giving out your number. BUT the upcoming events search and filters need some upgrades. Needs smaller increments for distance, and ability to filter by event start time (beyond the vauge ""starting soon""- like what if it's Sun and I'm looking for something starting at 6pm on a Tuesday etc.), event length (duration), location (City), topic, face covering required, etc. Great community of users! Just missing features",2
com.meetup,Misty Blue,Gets worse with each new update. Before you could select morning/afternoon/evening/night and only see the meetups in the chosen time frame. Now you have to scroll through all the days events to find one for your time frame. A waste of time.,3

com.meetup,Matt S,Not cool how you have to pay $16.50-25 a month just to host your own events. Much improvement is needed such as but not limited to: a discussion forum for postings and threads.

It only loads a certain number of events, so if you live in a place with many events and sort by date, you can only see events up to a certain time (e.g., only up to 2 pm on a Saturday) because the maximum number of search results the app will list is reached.

Why would it not show only local first before showing you far away? Also first message I tried to send on my new account to someone in a group got flagged as spam. Don't know why.,1

com.meetup,Shannon Patterson,I love meetup but major areas that let the app down are the event and location search. Even if I put my city the minimum distance you can choose is 2 miles; no option for exact location? Also even if I do select 2 miles to try and narrow it down it still returns results from other cities and areas in England so it doesn't work. There's also no option to filter your search on time of day. Both these things combined mean you spend ages scrolling to find events you could actually attend.,3

com.meetup,Judy A,"As of 5/13, the app unceremoniously mutes participants during chat sessions. Their reputation for false positives for fraud/spam are legendary since 2013. My ability to post to colleagues after posting with them 20 times has been blocked ie. false positive for spam. Convoluted process to get posting ability restored. Dead air after 24 hours filing a ticket. Terrible service. It only works as long as you don't engage in conversation. We're looking for an alternative. uGetTogether has potential.",1
com.meetup,Laurie Joan,"I have had this app for years and had to reload it twice, but I get none of the notifications. Very difficult when you are a co-organizer. It would be great to hear suggestions as to how to fix this",1
com.meetup,A Google user,Edit 05/2021: Why are the message boards not supported at all through the app? Following a link to a message board thread in the app opens it in a mobile browser window requiring you to log in again which is clumsy as hell.,3

com.meetup,TheMirroredImage,"Haven't used it much, so it's hard to form any conclusions; it does seem really ambitions -- seemingly in a good way. I can see it being a great way to publicize events and make new connections with people you share interests and hobbies with or things you've never done that maybe sound like something you'd want to try. The other side I can see, at least with Covid-19 going on, is it being empty due to out current tight restrictions.",3

com.meetup,M in'em,"Meetup apparently never cares about the insane amount of duplicate postings, some just have small Changes with 90% or more of the same info, time, date, etc. I have seen 20 or more posts for the same event which is crazy. I have emailed various times with no response. It seems they got rid of the map option for searching and now it only has a list feature which ruins it for many locations with duplicate listings that isn't a concern to meetup.",1
com.meetup,Gina Milligan,"I've met amazing people & participated in wonderful events because of this app! I've been able to expose my kids to live theater & classical music for FREE through MeeetUp.

com.meetup,C,"It's ok. I've gone to a few meetups and have generally had good experiences with them. However, it seems you can't join an event that has already started, even if it's online, which doesn't really make sense. Later, the app timed out when sending a message and sent tons of duplicates on my behalf when it finally reconnected, leading to me being banned. Don't expect timely assistance from their support in that case.",1

com.meetup,Bruno Ferreira,"Dangerous app for organisers. Meetup sends an email to banned members saying they got banned. There's no way around it, if you wanna ban a member who've misbehaved and broke the rules, he'll get the email. What happens next? Some of these people will send messages with insults and threats, saying they are going to show up at the events regardless and they are ""coming with friends"". Thanks so much Meetup to keep the organizers safe :)",1

com.meetup,Winton Wings,best app,5
com.meetup,Kelly S,"I'm having problems where the widget isn't updating, it still says ""tomorrow"" for events that are actually today.

com.meetup,Cynthia Hammer,outdoor events save lives,5
com.meetup,Bruce Kaplan,"Worst version yet. They either removed the calendar completely or hid it in complete hatred for their users. There is no way to see any of the upcoming Meetups for your groups. Tell me please, what exactly is the point of this now? **Edit** The calendar feature is back, but the app is still not as funtional as the desktop site. It is hit or miss when you seach for groups; sometimes tou find them, sometimes you cannot. Also, the app is buggy when you try to pull up other user's profiles. 3/5 ***",2
com.meetup,Alexander Liu,"The app was actually fine and easy to use. But after the latest update. Whenever I scroll through events in my grounds, before I get past 3 days into the future, the page will auto refresh bringing me back to the current date. Very frustrating",1
com.meetup,J W,"The site is ok. The app? Ehhhh. Slow, often fails to load, and when I 'explore' local meetups they're not even able to be sorted by time?! Seeing 2 pm and 6 pm meetups strewn together is useless and actively impedes the use of the site.",1

com.meetup,Lisabeth Ryder,"MeetUp app is awkward. you cannot navigate the app or find features easily. The meaning system is not intuitive. I enjoy the community the concept has created, but someone needs to redesign the app, make it more fluid plus add functionality to make organizing easier.",2
com.meetup,Tani Hatch,There are A TON of groups on here and it's a wonderful tool to meet people whether you're new to a place or it's somewhere you've lived you entire life. The app has a pretty simple layout.,5

com.meetup,Randy Gault,"It's like borders don't exist in this app. It's full of things it thinks I should know about in the country next door, which nobody can even get to because of Covid. Even if we could get there, the issues are different. But I can't see what's going on in the next town down the road, unless I get this other country as well. Total fail.",1

com.meetup,ABU SAIF ABDULLAH,Nice app,5
com.meetup,Michael Porter,"Some of the new changes are excellent. The app, however, could still use some of the options the web version of Meetup has. Some things, arguably little. For one, if I approve someone to join a group while using the app, I automatically get a confirmation email. On the web, I get the option to bypass this. The chat system doesn't make much sense. Works better on the web. Even then, that post character limit...",3

com.meetup,Halina,"Just not what I personally expected. In rating the app I have to give an overall opinion. It is too expensive to use for individuals who might be able to do some important things through the app. As far as rating the app itself, it is not too difficult to figure out, but it took me awhile, and I am not even sure I really understood how to use it. I wish I was more help to the developer, but again this is an overall opinion.",3

If you used the app yourself you would know the issues we are all experiencing on a regular basis.",1
com.meetup,Roland Hartwell,"meet up is an excellent way of meeting new people and experiencing new ideas as you seek to join various clubs, etc. want to hike with new friends then check it out. need to get more info about the UFO concern, well, there are others with the same desires so get out your phone and get into meet up and fine your new cause. You will be glad I did. do it, do it now.",5
com.meetup,: D,"As an app it was very good but lately has changed for the worse. Now shows a poor, low resolution version of profile photos. Very bad for some photos. Am forced to go to the website. As a company, Meetup really drops the ball. So many fake profiles on the platform that Meetup allow to exist. Even after reporting with evidence Meetup do nothing. Meetup is a stalker's paradise. This company started with good intentions but has been sold & resold and is now an uncaring money-making machine. STITCH",1

com.meetup,Mark Watson,"Flakey app. Different functionality from website. Refresh intermittent. Missed notifications. Biggest problem for organizers: Editing events on mobile deletes all line breaks and leads to a jumbled mess of text without intended logical, visual breaks.

com.meetup,Marty Riordon,Exceptional app! Very informative.,5
com.meetup,M S,"Slow and laggy. Annoying to have to log in laptop to fix group settings cos the app is useless. Take so long for messages to be received. Click send and message didnt appear, clicked several times and it finally did, when refreshed the same message appeared several times. It went through but didn't show the first few times. hard to communicate with others during events. the person was lost and i only received his message after more than 10mins. So made it look like i ignored them.",2

com.meetup,Gianluca Casu,"Buggy, unreliable, misses the point. The comment system in the events is amateurish to be kind, easily breaking a conversation. The application keeps on trying to clutter your main view with all meetup on your zone. Let's be clear about one thing I KNOW what I LIKE. I will search accordingly, mind your own business. It is the Facebook of the meeting applications, you do not want to use it, but all your friends are there.",1
com.meetup,Kailyn Champlin,Push notifications need some work.,3
com.meetup,Tanuki Soba,Great app for meeting people in the actual world ;~) Suggest that you extricate yourselves from the Cult of Facebook. Resetting my password after deleting my Facebook account was harder than it needed to be.,4

com.meetup,Naz Ali,There are so many sick men harassing and messaging despite warnings. I tried to block but the block feature doesn't work for certain profiles. There is no way to directly contact meetup on such issues. I'm notsure if ill get response here. Is meetup not safe for women?Anyone can send any explicit messages and I have to just keep quiet ? Is this the standard and level of your app? I'm constantly reporting that profile but no action is being taken.Why?I am unable to block that person. Disappointed,1

About the app : the search engine can be a bit lacking, especially when you're looking for that one particular group name.

com.meetup,Michael Barkerhicks,"So far so good with this app. I have had some difficulty connecting with people outside my professional networks to find new friends but Meetups is now making that process easier, one that is seemingly effortless for young people to just make bulk friends, but we forget how to do once we pass a threshold, when it's more about household budgets rather than random house party's, bed shopping rather than bed hoping.

All I want to do is see what email address I have tied to this account. Can't. Why? Can't find it. Not in my profile where I would expect it to be. Not in Settings under Personal Information.

Update 2: Uninstalling and reinstalling the app solved the issue - a simple update didn't.",4

I would give the App a 5-Star rating if some of the search options allowed you to filter by Date/Location/etc. I have a difficult time finding local meetups - whenever I search something like, say, a 'Book Club' and set it for my location, it shows me meetup groups that are from other parts of the state and it doesn't organize them based on date which is a real bummer!

No longer shows events for the current day, can no longer narrow down your results in any meaningful way, shows so few things I'm interested in that I get far better results when I'm using a browser and not logged in, too expensive to create groups now, etc. It's like they deliberately broke it.",2

UPDATE: The app still continues to be unresponsive in notification tab. I get a notification on my phone about an event, but when I get inside the app to notification tab it shows a blank page with the same error message.

Yes ..that means you are stuck scrolling endlessly among events of indeterminate time in the future and organized random groups/interests that you have zero affinity to.

com.meetup,Ale Leal,Online events during pandemic makes me feel comfortable in my home and do not think about what is going on outside,5
com.meetup,Kelly Perry,Provides a clear product. My only issue is that I don't see the notifications. I've checked settings and push is on but they don't show.,4
com.meetup,Zubair Rabnawaz,"Notification button problem hasn't gone away, they fix one thing and breaks another.",1
com.meetup,David Yeski,Works well for the most part. Great way to meet up with like minded peeps.,4
com.meetup,Elena Lar,The app became difficult to navigate. You can no longer search events by a specific date or sort it by time. This is the basics that are absolutely required. Could you please clarify why these search options were removed and whether they can be brought back? I agree with those who says the app was better years ago. It is becoming worse with every new update.,2
com.meetup,47,App will ask for a location but wont let me set a radius. How do they expect people find groups near them?,1
com.meetup,Aubrey,We love hosting Happy Hour! Meetup gives us the opportunity to meet new people and have a great time together!,5
com.meetup,Stewart Kendrew,"I have not only had the chance to meet some wonderful friends,through joining, meetup.I have also found that,my attitude has changed immensely,because of there friendly nature.",5
com.meetup,lrts,I have REMOVED 'rate the meetup' from groups that I belong to. You IGNORE MY SETTING & SEND IT TO ME AFTER EACH MEETUP I ATTEND. YOU ALSO DO THIS IF I AM NOT USING THE APP & I'M ON MY LAPTOP. WHY HAVE SETTINGS IF YOU DO NOT HONOUR THEM?,1
com.meetup,Jan Olymphe Chua,Cannot even install app,1
com.meetup,Gabrielle Hill,"Really happy I found this app/website, as it has helped me meet new people and make new friends that otherwise I would have struggled to find. Maybe a suggestion for improvement would be to make it cheaper to run a group.",4
com.meetup,sue brown,Not giving me any of the intrests i stated. Im looking for a womans book club (with wine) and/or a craft club (not necessarily with wine!),1
com.meetup,paul hayes,Online social meetings a great way to avoid the isolation feeling during this pandemic. Still not as good as face to face but starting to work it in my life. üôèü¶â,5
com.meetup,Amberly Marckini,"Won't allow me to actually creat an account due to invalid oauth credentials no matter if I'm giving full access to Facebook, using my main email, or a separate email. Pretty irritating.",1

com.meetup,Judi Couch,User Friendly app and a good way to keep up with any Meetups events.,5
com.meetup,Hailey Cassidy,"Help I keep getting a message that says, ""invalid oauth credentials""?",2
com.meetup,James Wiley,"Not getting timely notifications for all my groups. Sometimes get a notification but cannot open to the event page. Always says something went wrong. I rely on my desktop and see that I have missed notifications from my groups, several public and several private. Sometimes notifications show up 12 hours later or not at all. Thanks.",1
com.meetup,Sandy Bravo,Have to download more apps to be part of said meetups. Would be better if they had all the tools in one app.,1
com.meetup,shulmani,"As an organizer of a meetup group and user of this app for almost 8 years, it is going down with every ""Update"" lately. Many of the functions that were used to work fine before are no longer working. I have read through all the reviews and everyone is referring to the issues I also face. Nothing being resolved. Maybe it is time to say goodbye to this once loved platform. Can't upload photos from the app. Can't edit events without losing the main body of the text and many other issues!",1
com.meetup,Justin Wilia,Good,5
com.meetup,Manuel Kober,"The app is not a bad idea and it is working well. I think it still needs some improvements. For example, the filters are not working well. When you search for something, you get options 60 miles away, and nothing to do with what you was looking originally. Also, the majority of the meeting are online and there is no possibility to remove them from the filter. I hope theses improve in the future.",3
com.meetup,malik davis,Takes forever to load and when looking for things to do it only goes up to an hour away so cant see other events happening,1
com.meetup,Ryan Werner,I've only gone to a small handful of events and I've already met some pretty cool people. This application has helped me find like minded individuals and groups who are interested in the same thinhs I am. It does what it says it does and it does it well!,5

com.meetup,Michael Matsko,"Marginally functional. Can't select text, can't get to polls, etc.",2
com.meetup,Abrahan Ferrer,"Excellent app, you can find many groups with different topics, so you can meet people, you can share knowledge and of course you can learn.",5
com.meetup,Roisin Leahy,Really easy to navigate.,5
com.meetup,Jos√© Manuel Garc√≠a Locubiche,very useful,5
com.meetup,Eliza J,Why can't you just text us updates automatically. I have messages and notifications turned on yet I never actually receive them as a pop up on my screen. It's too hard to actually remember to check the app regularly for notifications and messages. Its just so not user friendly. I often miss out on things that I would have liked to have gone to but there is never a pop up like with other app notifications stating next month's events. Or upcoming events. And I'm only a member of two groups.,2
com.meetup,Lea Hendy,"So many genuine groups to join, went to my first get together last night & loved it. Many more to come",5

com.meetup,Sharon Morris,"It's a great tool. The comments from members on events helps a lot, for several reasons.",5
com.meetup,Deborah Hlu,Antiquated and you can't cancel your subscription. Tried for October cancellation and and they charged me again until Nov.,1
com.meetup,Ray,"Depending on the city, there can be a lot to do if you are new to a place",5
com.meetup,Nuno Curado,"Overall it's a fine app, but: editing an already published event erases any eventual formatting; I never get any notification on the phone (although I checked everything and they should show up); messages don't automatically update.",4
com.meetup,Lesley Majewski,Amazing glad I did the zumba class,5
com.meetup,Robert Kulze,Garbage,1
com.meetup,Evelyn Hamilton,Meetup is life saving,5
com.meetup,Courtney Ukena,Convenient app and works well. No invasive ads. Some notification settings don't work correctly. I have event reminders turned off but I still get the notification anyways and new event messages don't show through the notification link. Slightly annoying but tolerable.,4
com.meetup,Jirali Shu,"Why give people the option to not specify their gender with nonbinary or ""prefer not to say"" if you don't accept anything except male or female? What purpose does it serve except to piss people off?",1
com.meetup,Alexandra K.,I'm on a Samsung A50 and am not using the default calender app. Can you please support any type of calender app for exporting events? I really dislike that you only offer exporting events to the default Samsung calender app. Don't have this issue with any other app.,3
com.meetup,Lucas souza abdala,Amazing app,5

com.meetup,The Curious Adventures of Juliette,"Each screen takes forever to load, whether on WiFi or Data. And despite me continuously putting in my location, I'm only shown events that are dozens of miles, if not states away.",1
com.meetup,Alexandra Nemcovska,"Recent changes are making this not possible to use. I don't see new events posted in my main feed. Didn't get notifications. I only see the new event on the desktop, nothing in the phone app. Even if I specifically go in the group (on the desktop since I don't see it on the phone) and into the event and try to open the event Meetup tells me to login even though I am and I'm in a viscous loop of never getting into the event. Event hosts can't setup waitlists, comments are disabled. Useless",1
com.meetup,aky A,Can't live without meetup,5

com.meetup,Anne Harris,Old version better.. errors with upgrade not happy.,2
com.meetup,Jenasis Free Meraki Messages & Music,great way to connect with interests and community,5
com.meetup,Dipanjan Saha,"Never thought I'd give meetup a bad feedback with utter disappointment, you've recently taken away the ONE MOST useful feature, 'choose a date' in search. If someone is available only on a particular day, it's utterly pointless, irritating and painful to scroll through 500 irrelevant events. Scrolling through so much junk, one either gives up or misses the one they may have liked. Just because you can, doesn't mean you have to meaninglessly change things. There was no point of taking it away.",2
com.meetup,Michael Pritchard,"What a great app for community building, and it's growing like mad. Best way to use my phone to stop wasting time just on my phone.",5
com.meetup,Stephen Daye,Cool,1
com.meetup,Rob Pudney,"VERY USER UN-FRIENDLY / TIME WASTING!!! Rather than set options / preferences settings for each MU, allow global default to ALL, w ability to tweak individual MU's...but they don't honor them anyway! CSR's unhelpful! Allow us to use our preferred SORT criteria and default to it! Too much wasted scrolling / refreshing due to they emphasizing PAST events! Allow us to post private comments on our view of others profiles (cute, bitchy, met at picnic, etc.). DON'T cover their CITY w MU blurb!",3

com.meetup,Dario Lopez-K√§sten,"Have to go through alm the steps of a new registration, including picture upload, only to be able to sign in upon reinstalling. App hangs at startup for no particular reason. Mixed languages in the UI - some of it in English, lots of it in Spanish. Why!?",3

com.meetup,Ayodeji Olagbaiye,I haven't been able to login to the app since I downloaded it. I'm logged on web. But the app for my Samsung S10+ doesn't seem to be working. It worked when I was using a Samsung S8 though,1
com.meetup,Mary Martin,As much as I love this app. My one complaint is that they have no way to reset your user name and password. I used this app for three years and just never logged off. Now that I lost my phone unable to access my page even as an event organizer. I just believe this is the most unreasonable part of this page. To reset all information should be straight forward. This is written in hope they will update their website/ system.,2
com.meetup,BhavZie,"Just had someone message me on WhatsApp saying that they got my number from meetup. I checked everywhere on this app and you cannot view this information anywhere on the app. You cannot even control it. If I somehow submitted it as my answer (I am pretty sure that I did not), it does not show you that either. The privacy policy and cookie policy are all blank. A BIG PRIVACY RISK",2

com.meetup,Cynthia O,I have had the opportunity to meet like minded people that i might not have otherwise been able to do so.,5
com.meetup,appanoid,"Great site. App looks nice enough but is buggy and feedback in fair reviews (TBF one star reviews are mostly childish and undeserved though) seems to be condescended to with no answers or timeframes for fixes of clearly stated issues. Features are not being requested, bugs in previously working features (eg sort by date) need fixing. Seems to be some poor development or product management letting the side down here.",3
com.meetup,Stan,"Nice app overall, however constantly having issues with uploading pictures to events. It just says ""upload failed"" for no reason, despite my connection is quite fast.",4

com.meetup,Ray Johnson,Vv,3
com.meetup,Tom Warren,"While the app was never a five star over the last few months it barely ranks a one star. Lately the notification button has failed to update, and the entire app has become increasingly""clunky"". The ability to instantly communicate with attendees is something that has long been missing, as is an acknowledgement for attendees receiving important information. For example, I had to cancel an event at the last minute due to weather. I had to trust that the message got out.",1
com.meetup,Paul Dobisz,"Well done! A very good app most of the time, but only sometimes, it gives a constant error message, ""something's gone wrong, please try again"" when changing between, home, notifications and messages. I can normally only stop this from happening, by removing and reinstalling the app from play store. I don't seem to have problems with other apps, so I don't think it's my phone causing the problem.",4

com.meetup,Fallen One,Let's me join groups via video of my choice. Lots of support groups,5
com.meetup,Joshua,Every review here you are ignoring and just suggest to the person if they are complaining about the removal of features such as searching for a specific date in the app(the calendar feature ony works on the desktop version) to go to the help center and suggest new features. This is not helpful as the issues/features are not new. Please address these issues directly in the reviews. The issues with the recent updates are widespread and not limited to the individuals that are on here.,1

com.meetup,devin sindle,I dont know if its just me or not but meetup dosnt really have any explanation on how to do things. Online there are very few things they do tell you. Not enough to make things easy as a joiner only as a host. The other aspect that im not sure if its a meetup server thing or the people im trying to message but the messages when talking back and fourth respond time seems to vary drasticly from 30 second to 30 minutes to not at all. Could also be the orginizers are not responsive or its just NJ.,3
com.meetup,Pauline Hinch,A great way to met people and do different things together,5
com.meetup,A Google user,Use it only because have to. Meaning to participate in an event you must be a member. However notifications are lousy. Don't work properly. CC doesn't bother to reply.
