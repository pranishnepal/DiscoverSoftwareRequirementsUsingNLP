## Discover App Requirements using NLP

---

This project uses the scraped App Reviews from Google Play Store in the `.csv` files, applies sentiment analysis to the reviews and models topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLD) to discover new requirements for an app.

The reviews also include review for competitior apps.

At the end, a recommendation is made to the app's owners. You can see it at the end of the `.ipynb` file.
