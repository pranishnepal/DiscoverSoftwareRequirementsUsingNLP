com.zchandev.zchanapp,Zach,P good. Only wish that 2chn was in English instead of Russian but other than that solid purchase,4

com.zchandev.zchanapp,The WolfeMan’s Wall of Vinyl,"Ever since the 2/8/22 update, I get an error message when trying to save a video just like the other recent reviews. The app also crashes every time I try to watch a webm or video file. I've been sending error reports. App used to work great but it's close to useless now and I'm disappointed that I paid for it. Hopefully this is addressed and fixed soon.",1

com.zchandev.zchanapp,Michael Quinn,Can't retarget bulk thread saving location. Now trying to save anything directly results in Invalid Argument(s) issues.,2
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Meger Niche,"Don't update, as of Feb 12 this is a bad idea.",2
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Dragon Warrior,"doesn't work, the captcha doesn't load and i can't even backspace, i want a refund",1
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Drake Panzer,It's a ported iOS app rather than a native Android app. Clover is better.,1
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Jordan Fire Star,"Very good client that works as it should. It would be cool if you could search all boards for something, but that's just a suggestion that doesn't make or break the app. I also really appreciate the statistics and hours counted, which many other clients don't have",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Jack Wagner,"Hey man, I try and make posts, post images, etc., and receive this error message: NoSuchMethodError: the method ""split"" was called on null. Receiver: null. Tried calling: split(). Can you please advise? I like your app a lot but would like to make posts, haha. Thanks!",4

com.zchandev.zchanapp,Jerry Pena,"Webm not saving or showing in gallary on LG V60? Any help? Edit: fixed, thank you! Edit: I had a suggestion: How about being able to highlight/block multiple threads at a time? That would be great instead of currently only lighting one then getting the option to hide or remove.",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Jonathan Rosado,"Best 4chan client I've tried. Sadly Mimi and Omnichan's support went out the window and got removed from the Playstore, but they don't compare to this one. Here's to hoping you'll keep it running for the good while.",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Heck Policeman,Having issues when it comes to actually making posts. Other than that it's a pretty good app,3
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Dan,"Good app in general. One problem though is that it upscales webm & gif downloads. E.g. if you download a gif from a 4chan board that is 1mb, it will save it on your phone as 8mb. So when you want to upload the same webm in a different thread you can't due to 4chan size limit. Can't see anything about this in the settings so I'm guessing it's a bug.",4
com.zchandev.zchanapp,IG ENG,"I would give it a better review if their capcha system wasn't completely unintelligible. Can't post without figuring it out, an AI would be better able to discern their capchas, defeating their purpose, stopping people from posting. Haven't gotten one yet, out of over 100 tries.",1

com.zchandev.zchanapp,James Reese,"Good stuff mate, keep it up. A long time mimi user here who had enough of shi- not working. This is a great replacement.",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Shiggy,"After some major bug issues being patched over (hopefully for good) and an attentative Dev who does respond to complaints, I've got to say it's not bad overall. The app takes a bit getting used to and a visit to the settings for personalizing it will really help. Omni and Mimi will always have a place in our hearts, let's hope Zchan can do the same. Keep up the great work",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,litl snek,"only has select boards, doesnt even have /b/",1
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Matthew,"I had some trouble enabling the NSFW boards on my previous phone, and now, it is impossible for me to do so on my new device. I can search for them, but there is no button to enable it in the platforms tab. This is a bit of an issue considering how popular /pol/ is, but the dev is very active, and I have faith in a quick fix. Overall, this is a great app. I wouldn't have bought it if it weren't for the new captcha, but this was a good purchase I will continue to use.",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Skidwheels 12,I liked the free version (google ichan apk) so much that I wanted to support the dev. Great app so far and hopefully the dev wont rugpull us like mimi's dev.,5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Bradley Nelson,"Nice app. Can we get a two-column catalog view at some point? Edit: I'm dumb, thanks",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,MAXKILLER 215,App is fully updated on my device. Captchas are still completely unreadable making it impossible to post or comment.,1
com.zchandev.zchanapp,kariminalo,"Overall a handy mobile imageboard browser, however would be nice if you could add a larger image search engine when attaching images to a post. Current one fetches little results from when searching for images.",4

com.zchandev.zchanapp,chris benavides,"Like the app, only thing I really want is the ability to make the images bigger because most of the time they are cropped horribly.",4
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Stephen Kanes,"Excellent app with plenty of good features, the only thing stopping me giving it 5 stars is the app keeps telling me I've mis-typed the Captcha since the new system was implemented even when I know I've got it right.",4
com.zchandev.zchanapp,A E,"UI is great, and easy to navigate, however the new captcha doesn't seem to work on the app. I've posted on my phone browser just fine, but on this app the captcha never works and at the moment I can only read posts rather than engage Update: uninstalled then reinstalled and seems to be working again",5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Carter Jones,"There are some things that should be changed that will make this app worth the money. Bookmarked threads should be easier to access, like on the clover app. EDIT: I previously gave 2 stars, but the developer got back to me and mentioned half the stuff I was suggesting was actually in the settings, so I've given is 4 stars. Very based.",4
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Matthew Fernandez,"Pretty good so far. Please let me know if these things are possible because I can't find them: 1) Display a count when swiping through a thread's images (e.g. ""4/55"" when I'm looking at the 4th of 55 images). I like to know where I am in the thread when swiping through images. 2) Display the image size/extension somewhere besides the thumbnail (takes up too much room and obscures the image). 3) Change the font color, regular text and greentext (I wish the greentext font was lighter green).",4
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Scott Hager,UI is light-years ahead of any other 4chan client on mobile and the developer is constantly taking in feedback for future implementations or fixes. Thanks for such a great app,5
com.zchandev.zchanapp,redeem 0796425,humans cannot solve the captcha. anything other than posting works.,2
com.zchandev.zchanapp,Red Label,"yeah really good. got some nice features like replies and stuff. i would recommend they checkout some alternative apps and pull in any features they have missed. ie. organising images into sub-boards would be decent. the app works really well though, keep up the good work 💪",4

com.zchandev.zchanapp,Ancapᅚᅚ,Decent overall. I don't understand the point of hiding the 18+ boards when you agree to being 18 upon installation though. Solid 8/10.,4
com.zchandev.zchanapp,rezbit,Has potential. OP images need to be much larger. See Omnichan as an example.,3

one.phobos.omnichan,Johnny Jam,"Idk what the hell you guys did, but before this update it worked COMPLETELY fine (apart from the captcha bs, which I understand has nothing to do with the devs). But now it's SUPER buggy and laggy. Even refreshing the boards/threads causes the app to freeze up entirely. I was stoked to see the update, but honestly it's not worth it. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that you threw up an update. But, I'd rather use Mimi at this point. It's dead, but at least it'll run much smoother.",3
one.phobos.omnichan,Usama Gilani,Keeps freezing and doesnt download all the images😒,1
one.phobos.omnichan,Nikhil Singh,Certainly better than Readchan.,5
one.phobos.omnichan,Parker K,"The dev has been working hard lately to update the app to work with the new 4chan CAPTCHA and it shows. Great app, it's quick and looks nice. The developer is also really responsive if you reach out to them. Best 4chan app out there!",5

one.phobos.omnichan,Crushing Flood,"Works great now, accelerate!!!!",5
one.phobos.omnichan,S Alam,This has been a great app so far. I'd up the review to 5 stars if it was possible to enable an option to view the latest 1 or 2 replies from every thread from the board page which doesn't seem to be the case. Other than that I have no requests.,4
one.phobos.omnichan,Suresh Chand,Dev could you just add ability to download content to sd card.,5
one.phobos.omnichan,هڠ چيمڤاك,worthless app don't download it,1
one.phobos.omnichan,Mr. E,Captcha is unsolvable 75% of the time because the slider does not start in the correct position or allow enough scroll.,2
one.phobos.omnichan,Jordan Cole,"Ok so listen, I've had this app installed for less than 5 minutes, I'm already in love with this app. Anything that allows me to browse 4chan without going to 4chan on my phone (usually how I browse) makes me feel better. I just don't want any viruses. Plus it gave me a reason to finally uninstall Reddit.",5
one.phobos.omnichan,Srj,finally it's back. I'm sooooo happy. thanks,5
one.phobos.omnichan,monktonians,The crashes and freezes make it almost unusable. Updating to the latest version made no difference.,1
one.phobos.omnichan,# .,"Not as good as Mimi but given the options it's slightly better than the rest and is minimally easier to navigate than the browser. It could use a grid view when browsing images within a thread, when you select the face image of a thread the image viewer should show images from that thread instead of just scrolling through all of the threads. The app is slow...... especially when loading images and webms, the browser is at least 20 times faster.",3
one.phobos.omnichan,Patrick Johnson,Really nice app. No intrusive ads and the UI is really nice. Dev is working hard and has made lots of updates recently,5
one.phobos.omnichan,Luke Willis,"Dev has been extremely hardworking when it comes to fixing all the issues involved with integrating the V3 captcha nonsense, and getting this app back on the Play store. Great job.",5
one.phobos.omnichan,Alexander Supertramp,When are you going to update for 8kun?! Its getting better. But it's still froggy..... 5 star when you fix it for 8kun :(,2
one.phobos.omnichan,Ben J,Auto play doesn't work even when it is selected in the options.,2
one.phobos.omnichan,Ryan,"Love the app, but recently has been freezing when loading .webm files",2
one.phobos.omnichan,Caber Smith,"what happened? I've been using omnichan for years and it was nearly perfect, but lately I can't even open it without crashing. it's fundamentally broken now.",1
one.phobos.omnichan,Jenn J,"It's a great idea to have access to 4chan plus other sites. The app keeps freezing and force closing though. Select a site to browse all boards, select a board, try to view a board, etc. Everything makes this app freeze up unfortunately. Although I love the idea of this app, and haven't found another app with the same features, the app is unusable as it is on my phone. I would like to eventually see a ""browse all subscribed"" or something to that affect.",2
one.phobos.omnichan,Alex Green,"Edit: works normally now after some updates! Original: The app isn't as smooth of an experience as it used to be, but based on the Omnichan subreddit, the dev is putting a lot of work into fixing it. Even with bugs, I prefer it over 4chan's mobile site. Still worth downloading imo! Side note, the new 4chan captcha is a steaming pile of garbage. Sadly this app can't fix that, but just wanted to complain about it.",5
one.phobos.omnichan,A Google user,Doesnt supports 8kun,1
one.phobos.omnichan,Wade Lyons,Can't edit my poor review but bugs fixed that were annoying me. CAPTCHA still has issues here an for there,4
one.phobos.omnichan,derp derpstein,"Can't read the stupid CAPTCHAs so I can't post anything. It makes you wait 20 seconds to get a new one, then 40 seconds, then 60 the more you fail. This app is only usable for reading, not posting.",1

one.phobos.omnichan,Kyle Taylor,"Edit: Dev pushed a bug fix, works just like it used to! Latest update broke the app. App opens with no boards, and attempting to do literally anything in the app causes it to crash. Good app until 11/7/21 update.",5

one.phobos.omnichan,Gatts The Broken,With the recent update the app is now fixed and back to running smoothly.,5
one.phobos.omnichan,Nick N,Nice to see the app being updated again. Not many alternatives out there and this app just werks for the most part. Recently though app has been becoming a bit slower and unresponsive (Android 11). For example when opening a thread or board - there's like 1.5-2 sec delay before anything appears. 1-2 weeks ago (I presume before recent updates) it was much smoother and quicker experience. No idea what the issue is.,3

It crashed constantly, you cant back out of a comment without everything being deleted, you can't even type anything out without a large black bar blocking everything but your current line of text.

one.phobos.omnichan,A Google user,"Update for 2020: The developer has abandoned this app entirely, with no updates for two years. He has also let his website expire. Don't worry, he'll still collect ad revenue and offers a paid ""pro"" version for sale! One of the five supported websites is no longer accessible as the domain changed, and the developer is no longer around to update it. What happens when any of the remaining sites goes through a domain change? There are major technical issues that have never been addressed, and now never will. As pointed out by other reviewers, you will need to still access the website directly in a web browser to see ban/warning messages, and to double check if your thread creation succeeded. You will very often get fake timeout errors when creating a thread - the thread creates, but the app thinks posting failed. Further, if you lose connection for any reason, the entire thread you're in is removed from view. Once you restore connection, you have to refresh the page, and find your place manually all over again. If the thread gets deleted while you're reading it, the app also deletes the page from your view instead of just reporting that the thread is no longer available. The app is still relatively functional, but has little point to use unless you really like accessing lainchan, 420chan, or wizardchan. 8chan is gone, and there are far better apps that haven't been completely abandoned you can use to access 4chan. If Phobos ever decides to come back to the realm of the living, maybe something will get fixed. Until then, don't expect any technical issues to be resolved.",1

one.phobos.omnichan,James,Fun little reader. Let's you completely filter out some of the rude boards. *chan at its best :),5
one.phobos.omnichan,A Google user,Good imageboard application but the image processing is very poor. A majority of images do not render properly and there isn't a visual queue in place in the GUI to show you that it's buffering. Unless it's a low quality jpg the image will not render properly and you're stuck with a static blurry rendition.  Only thing that seems to work is to exit and reopen the image several times but that doesn't always work so you're stuck in many cases.  Overall it's a fantastic app but this particular problem really hinders my enjoyment of the app. I think I'm just going to keep the app and hope it gets fixed but until then I'm forced to use alternatives.,4
one.phobos.omnichan,Blade Gamba,Good. Please make it like Mimi Reader. UI wise. Good job on this app,4

one.phobos.omnichan,Sebastian Holtze,"Doesn't allow for screen rotation, so widescreen images and webms have to be viewed vertically. Also, webms don't autoplay when clicked on, so you have to press play after opening it, which doesn't make a lot of sense. Other than that, it works fine.",3
