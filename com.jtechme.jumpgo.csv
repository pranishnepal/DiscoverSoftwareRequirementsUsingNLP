Lightning's extra mouse-drag.content navigation is easier and faster than Chrome's remote control arrow-down and page-down mouse navigation. I tested dozens of Android browsers. Lightning is the one with the best balance of features. Lightning is feature-rich like Chrome without the bloat, mouse-friendly like Firefox, and, best of all, it has options to offload certain links to external apps like YouTube that are better able to render content.  I also like READER MODE with independent font size and dark mode flexibility. Old versions of Lightning were fast but feature-poor. The new Lightning has both speed and great features.",5

Despite being very light on resources, it still has all of the main browser features I need.  I find I almost never use Chrome or Opera  anymore, as Lightning has replaced them.  Only a few sites like Google Maps require I still use Chrome, but that's so infrequent.

If I open an incognito tab then I can no longer access my other tabs and any other tabs I open are automatically also incognito tabs. Also, if I minimise the app and then re-open it using the shortcut, my incognito ""window"" and all its tabs disappear and my normal tabs reappear. This is highly impractical and unintuitive.

One is the ability to close multiple tabs at once - for example by not closing the sidebar when you close a tab. Then you would be able to easily close all the tabs you don't need without having to open the sidebar for every one. Another suggestion is adding a button to close all tabs at once - so basically an exit button. These 2 features would make this app almost perfect :),4

And when  the tabs pile up, the browser slows way down. The good side is it's a more compact app, so when you don't have a lot of tabs open it's fast as hell. I don't think I'll be keeping it because of the bugs, but I'll give it another week or so to see if it somehow improves. Edit: Gave up in one day.. Had to uninstall.",3

I honestly don't believe Naked Browser user consider this a good app. If you haven't tried Naked Browser then hold off on hitting that install button. Just read the reviews and you'll see how the dev actually replies to the majority. So many ppl left hanging here. I used this app for 5 mins and found 3 flaws that i don't see in any other browser. 1. In landscape text box gets covered by keyboard. 2. Once i pulled the keyboard down to edit my_ text, i find the cursor disappears. So where am i typing? & 3.

There's still ways to go when compared to ""naked browser"", both in terms of performance, features & size, but I can see the slowly gap narrowing. The dev. is very responsive to bug reports; keep going!",4

acr.browser.barebones,Edwin Owen,"I would not say it's lightning quick, but it is quick. The problem is the're are absolutely no feature's what so ever. Even basic ones, for example: if I click a YouTube video it does not ask if I'd like to use the YouTube app to watch it. The developer will say it's to make it faster and not drain as much battery etc. This is true but small features like the above mentioned should be included. Other browsers are just as fast, if not faster and include some very nice features, such as Opera.",3

acr.browser.barebones,Junkang Gao,"This browser is very nice and I think the speed is on par with the stock AOSP browser. However, I think that you you add a request desktop site toggle, that is what's holding me back to using it fully",4

The reason you succeeded with your browser was because you weren't downranking sites. Choosing to downrank Russian sites so soon after the Ukranian invasion is obviously a political decision, even though you say it isn't, and it's awful.

If you long-press a link, it'll bring up a pop-up menu (""Open in Background/Open in New Tab/etc."") which takes up 30% of my screen--and if I happen to be long-pressing a link on the bottom half of my screen, the ""Open in Background"" option will shift all the way to the top of my screen.

mark.via.gp,authuser1 171,"I've been using Via Browser for almost a year and honestly, it's good enough for me. It's fast and does the things it supposedly does. However, there are some cons, although I consider them as minor ones. One of which is the often freezing of the app when in dark mode and the other one is the disallowed useragent problem when signing in on some Google Services. About some users mentioning some concerns with regards to data issues, I wish our data would be taken care of properly. Also, with regards to the webview impl, can it possibly work with com.google.android.webview? Thanks!",3

mark.via.gp,Neander Heuri,I wasnt expecting it to be so good considering I tested it on Android 8.1..but it really put a smile on my dial. I cant wait to see how it goes on Android10. Its graceful and classy to use I dont even notice its supposed to be only Lite. When I think of the experienced programmer and his group I am thinking more magicians than genius. I without question recommend you give it a go. The zoom is also good eg it doesnt go too large and then suddenly too tiny..and can zoom some unlikely places,5

mark.via.gp,Sandro ƒê.,"This was suggested on several review sites as a lightweight browser with an inbuilt adblocker. It indeed is fast and effective in those regards, one of the best choices if you are looking for ease of use. It's also very customizable - I like to set my browser to run in immersive mode (use ADB to hide status/nav bar), and combined with the option in Via to hide the toolbars you can get true full screen viewing with nothing in the way, making browsing a real pleasure. There is some more room for customization, for example I'd like to be able to change elements on the address toolbar - in which case I'd leave nothing except a big address box and the exit app button, with the rest of the options appearing on a long press. Next, I noticed that swipe gestures for back/forward don't trigger if you're swiping a bit diagonally, which they should in my opinion, especially if you have a device which is easy to use in one hand. Lastly, sometimes loading a site hangs for 5-10 seconds for no particular reason, not related to connection quality, so perhaps the developer should look into it. Other than that, this is a near perfect replacement for stock browser apps, which tend to be bloated with options, rigid with customization and take up a lot of internal storage while inexplicably draining battery in the background.",5

com.kiwibrowser.browser,A Google user,"If you need an Android web browser which supports Chrome Extensions, Kiwi is one of the very few to do so. It's an excellent browser based on the Chromium-engine, so it inherits all of its core capabilities and modern user-interface. Kiwi also has many useful extra features such as built-in Ad-blocking, multiple dark themes, choice of tab switcher layout, Readability View for web pages, Text Rewrap while zooming, Edge swiping, toolbar placement configuration, force https connections, bypass AMP pages, Android Password Manager API support, and more. Should you need advanced ad and tracker blocking beyond the built-in capability, add it via a Chromes-extension such as Ghostery for example. Note that, alas, Kiwi does not have built-in automatic bookmark synching to other devices, but it can import/export them via a file. Feature requests for future versions: - add a setting to delete certain data upon browser-exit, such as clearing cookies, browsing history and cache - make it possible to configure the icons which appear on the Toolbar (Microsoft Edge & Samsung Internet browsers have a nice way of doing this) - move the Exit-button to the top of the side-menu, so we can quickly exit the browser without having to scroll to the end of the menu)",5
